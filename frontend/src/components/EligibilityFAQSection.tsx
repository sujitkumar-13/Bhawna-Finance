            question: "What is the minimum CIBIL score required for loan approval?",
            answer: "We typically require a minimum CIBIL score of 650 for personal loans, 700 for business loans, and 750 for home loans. However, we also consider other factors like income stability, employment history, and existing debt obligations in our assessment."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does the loan approval process take?",
            answer: "Our digital-first approach ensures quick processing. Initial approval can be received within 24 hours of complete application submission. Final disbursement typically takes 3-7 business days depending on document verification and loan type."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I apply for a loan if I am self-employed?",
            answer: "Yes, we welcome applications from self-employed individuals and business owners. You will need to provide additional documentation including ITR for the last 2-3 years, bank statements for 12 months, and business registration documents."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the maximum loan amount I can get?",
            answer: "Loan amounts vary by type: Personal loans up to ₹50 lakhs, Business loans up to ₹5 crores, and Home loans up to ₹10 crores. The actual amount depends on your income, credit profile, and repayment capacity."
        },
        {
            question: "Are there any prepayment charges?",
            answer: "We offer flexible prepayment options. For personal loans, there are no prepayment charges after 12 months. For business and home loans, prepayment charges may apply as per RBI guidelines and will be clearly mentioned in your loan agreement."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens if I miss an EMI payment?",
            answer: "We understand that financial situations can change. If you miss an EMI, we charge a late payment fee and it may impact your credit score. We recommend contacting our customer service immediately to discuss restructuring options if you face difficulties."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I increase my loan amount after approval?",
            answer: "Yes, you can apply for a top-up loan after completing 12 months of regular payments on your existing loan. The top-up amount will be subject to fresh eligibility assessment and documentation."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you offer loans to NRIs?",
            answer: "Currently, we primarily serve Indian residents. However, we do consider NRI applications on a case-by-case basis for specific loan products. Please contact our NRI desk for detailed eligibility criteria and documentation requirements."
